# 🎯 Number Guessing Game (Python)

A simple and fun number guessing game written in Python where the user tries to guess a randomly chosen number between 1 and 100 in 5 attempts. With every guess, the game gives a hint by narrowing down the range, helping you get closer to the correct answer!

---

## 🚀 How to Play

1. The program randomly selects a number between 1 and 100.
2. You have **5 attempts** to guess the number.
3. After each guess, you'll get a hint:
   - Whether your guess is too high or too low.
   - The updated range in which the correct number lies.
4. If you guess it right — 🎉 you win!
5. If not — ❌ game over, and the correct number is revealed.

## 🧠 Example Gameplay

🎯 Welcome to the Number Guessing Game! I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100. Enter a guess: 80 Number is in between 0 and 80, too high, try again 4 attempts left

Enter a guess: 50 Number is in between 50 and 80, too low, try again 3 attempts left

Enter a guess: 60 Number is in between 60 and 80, too low, try again 2 attempts left

Enter a guess: 70 Number is in between 60 and 70, too high, try again 1 attempts left

Enter a guess: 65 ❌ You failed. The number was 69

💡 Hints for Players
Think logically: each guess gives you a narrower range.

Don't repeat guesses; use the hint wisely.

You only have 5 chances, make each guess count!
